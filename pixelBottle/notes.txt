NOTES:
	TEXTURES:
		* Internal Format vs Format:
				Format is how OpenGl will deal with data
				Internal Format is how image data is stored

	SHADERS:
		* .shader helps debug files in msvs





QUESTIONS:
	- What other usere can glfwMakeContextCurrent() be used for?






ERRORS ENCOUNTERED:
	*	"LNK1104 cannot open file 'glfw3.lib"
			SOLUTIONS: 
				I was linking in the "External include directory" and not "Library Directory"

	*	Non-square PNG doens't load correctly. "snatti89_sunset.png" (non square, RGB) vs "snatti89_sunset1.png" (sqaure 512x512 pixels, RGB)
			SOLUTIONS:
				had to do with the format and the png itself. paint3d isn't good for exporting images. 

	*	I'm loading a png, "pixilatedWaterBottle.png" but the edges that should be transparent are actually black. 
			SOLUTION:
				glEnable(blending) and glBlendFunc needed to be included after the initialization of the window and other opengl inits
