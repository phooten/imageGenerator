	-	I've been adding logs to my other github projects to help track what I've done.
		Its been 24 Days so I wanted to track this so next time have a while between 
		working on it, I will know where I left off. 
	-	The last thing I remember working on was getting different png images to load 
		which seemed to depend on how the program saved it. I had issues when saving
		from 3D paint, but not from photoshop.
	-	I am leaning toward working through concepts that victor gordon teaches, and 
		using jamie king as an explaination suppliment. I think I'd use this program
		to do that so it would be up on github, and I'd try to make adjustments
		to cater to my own needs. Once done, I can make a copy and enhance what I 
		need to and take out the additional stuff from the tutorials.
