# Overview
The goal of this project is to allow a user to upload pictures via GUI. These pictures will then be randomly placed to create
a texture that can be saved, or wrapped around a virtual 3D object. 

## Examples:
Base PNG Image:<br />
<img src="https://github.com/phooten/imageGenerator/blob/master/references/WaterBottle.PNG?raw=true" width="250" height="250">

Texture Wrapped around object:<br />
<img src="https://github.com/phooten/imageGenerator/blob/master/references/Example.PNG?raw=true" width="250" height="250">


## Status:
A photo can be used to uploaded and used as a texture.  
I'm currently working on the GUI.
